<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Gerasimos Chatziygeroudis . It's a very long name I know . I'm Greek I am 21 years
  old and I am a proffesional table tennis player. I have been playing since 7 years old and I have
  many international achievements and medals. It has been my passions from a little kid and I'm really 
  happy I have achieved this level from a young age. 
</p>

<p>Also I try to study at the same time in university. I study computer science and being a programmer
  is for sure an option i would always want to have available. Since I was a little kid other than
  passionately playing table tennis I also developed a long term love for video games at first, and
  later on also for computer science.
</p>

<p>But being a student and a proffesional athlete is really hard and sometimes even impossible.
  This project will help me gain some experience in specific parts of programming I personally find
  interesting while at the same time practising my passion. This is achieved by formating my own 
  schedule , working the hours it's convenient for me .
  That's a quick outer inpection of myself and I hope you liked it!
